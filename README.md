## Deployment

To deploy the website I went onto github and clicked on my project, scrolled down to the bottom and switched the sauce from none to main. Then refreshed the page scroll back down and my link was there.

To run the code locally you will need to create a git hub acount, then go to my page [jamies56](https://github.com/JamieS56) and click on Milestone Project 2. There will be all the files and you can click on each one to view the code. You can then copy and paste the code into an editor for example git pod and run it yourself.
